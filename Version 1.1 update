Updates/Fixes:

NEW Trackpoint Marker Tool to generate Markers for Points of Interest based on a template you design (text will use name of trackpoint)
Update to KML importer - will now import KML files from Google My Maps
Improved messaging - alert on common error: when no trackpoints are in the JSON file, import will abort and message will be displayed to correct the issue (add trackpoint and export JSON file from GES).
Improvements for multiple KML files (fixes alignment issues)
